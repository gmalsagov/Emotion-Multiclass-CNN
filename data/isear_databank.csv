guilt,"Not attending school, when  am not sick - but in need of mental à rest. Staff on your return query your ""sickness"" - it is easier à in N.Z. to be sick, rather than confide other personal reasons à etc."

shame,"Like guilt - the most ashamed I have ever felt was when I began à to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was à only ""the thing to do"", and not really an act of love."
guilt,"This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I à (being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in à and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend.

Maybe you could call it gossip I à felt different after I had slept on it. If I had waited, thought, à NOW I would not have done it."
joy,"A good friend, the wife of the vicar of my church came up to me à from the pews (I am in the choir) and shook my hand during the à time for an informal ""greeting"" in the church service. She said a à few words."

disgust,Having moved into a flat within the last week I felt some disgust à that a bathroom tap had been left to drip with a faulty fawcet.

A very powerful à message."

After the picnic my classmates asked à me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone à mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in à the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me à as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind à afterwards.

The devil did not have any expression on à his face and I thought that he would choose me."
anger,My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that à he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's à house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I à felt that he did not respect me and moreover I was his friend so à he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is à I was in a bad mood then).
sadness,I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good à friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them à I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind à this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made à up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was à sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends.
disgust,"I had a friend who was very kind to me.  I tried my best to like à him and understand him but when I was with him I could not help à rejecting, criticizing and blaming him.  I wanted to get away à from him as soon as possible."

A close   à friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my à application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had à been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the à list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was à really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all à day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the à good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my à studies. à "
fear,A boy phoned me at night and wanted to talk to me for 30 minutes à outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would à question me on our relationship.

I was very à unhappy as I feared having hurt him and got him into trouble.

I was  à still very angry so I dropped my bowl and chopsticks and went to the kitchen  à to drink tea and then ran to the other side of the house."
joy,That afternoon I rushed home to look at the result slip of the à higher level as fast as possible.

I knew that if i failed again I woulld à have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period à - I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice à experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable à fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright à prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my à brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue à I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."

My roomate had à promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime à after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize à his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a à university student and ought to have self-respect.  He à disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him à and did not want to keep any contact with him."
shame,My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were à his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.  à Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I à felt ashamed at having misunderstood him.

fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was à afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very à unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of à passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to à repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results à were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a à minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
anger,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not à like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation à was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt à that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost à 5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower à than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not à show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September à I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in à the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not à find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about à sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  à I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
disgust,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had à melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played à the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell à him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right à to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to à leave the room and go somewhere else."
shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was à working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had à joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female à classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not à fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.

joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a à male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I à hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.
anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her à grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in à mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me à and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  à When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be à employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  à there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they à made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five à days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another à child to teach.
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had à prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After à three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and à failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others à would think that I had not prepared for it.
disgust,I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the à door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit à and bring the germs in the house.
shame,I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I à was scolded immediately.
guilt,I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when à I called out loudly.
